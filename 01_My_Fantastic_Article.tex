\section{Introduction}

In this research, we queried dozens of individuals, and learned that none of them were familiar with \LaTeX! We talked to many different kinds of people:

\begin{itemize}
				\item Students
				\item Researchers
				\item Grandparents
\end{itemize}

\noindent When asked if they knew how to use \LaTeX, these are the responses we got:

\begin{enumerate}
				\item What?
				\item Who?
				\item No
\end{enumerate}
